# Restaurant Bot

This example includes a file called `run.py`, which contains an example
of how to use Rasa directly from your python code.

## Whatâ€™s inside this example?

This example contains some training data and the main files needed to build an 
assistant on your local machine. The `restaurantbot` consists of the following files:

- **data/nlu.md** contains training examples for the NLU model  
- **data/stories.md** contains training stories for the Core model  
- **actions.py** contains some custom actions
- **config.yml** contains the model configuration
- **domain.yml** contains the domain of the assistant  
- **endpoints.yml** contains the webhook configuration for the custom action  
- **policy.py** contains a custom policy
- **run.py** contains code to train a Rasa model and use it to parse some text

## How to use this example?

To train your restaurant bot, execute
```
rasa train
```
This will store a zipped model file in `models/`.

To chat with the bot on the command line, run
```
rasa shell
```

Or you can start an action server plus a Rasa server by
```
rasa run actions
rasa run -m models --endpoints endpoints.yml
```
